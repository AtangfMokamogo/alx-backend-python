# Unittests and Integration Tests

## About

In this project, we learned about the importance of implementing unit tests and how they can help ensure the quality of our code. Specifically, we used the Python unittest module to create and run unit tests. The unittest module provides a core Mock class that allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used. Additionally, mock provides a patch() decorator that handles patching module and class level attributes within the scope of a test, along with sentinel for creating unique objects
